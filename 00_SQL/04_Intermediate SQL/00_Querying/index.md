### Querying Data

#### Let's Take a Deeper Look into Querying Data

We have dived into querying a little in the third chapter to select, create and insert data with SQL, now let's take deeper look.

#### An important thing to remember is we need to understand our data.

* How is it structured?

* What does it represent?

We can do different types of querying to figure these out!

#### Selecting Data

When we query this isn't actually changing the database. You're just choosing what data you'd like to see and how you want it to look.

#### Functions

Similar to Excel, in SQL we can use functions to help us understand our data.

Here are a few examples:

```SQL
SUM() `SELECT SUM(XYZ) FROM XYZ`

MAX() `SELECT X, Y, Z FROM XYZ`

MIN() `SELECT X, Y, Z FROM XYZ`

AVG() `SELECT XYZ FROM XYZ`

COUNT() `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM XYZ`
```
