This is the EXLskills free and open-source SQL Intro Course!

## New Course Checklist

- [ ] Update license parameters, specifically, add examples of what "source code" is in your course

- [ ] Create the course structure using EOCS (these are your chapters, sequentials, and verticals)

- [ ] Add your first piece of content to the course layout

- [ ] Run `eocsutil verify` periodically to check that your course adheres to the EOCS format

- [ ] Create an issue [here](https://github.com/exlskills/exlskills/issues/new?labels=new-course) to notify EXLskills of your intent to publish this course. After a brief review and validation, you should be ready to publish your EXLskills course. EXLskills team will add the course repo to the course pipeline and you should have your work on the master branch validated, converted, and published with each new commit.

- [ ] Congratulations, you published this course and can now drop this checklist from your README.md file :)

## Make Money by Sharing Your Skills

Open source courseware contributions are absolutely critical to the success of the [EXLskills.com](https://exlskills.com) mission, yet we all have to keep the lights on... To this end, we offer a peer-to-peer instruction (tutoring-like) conversational interface that learners can use to have their questions answered by a certified EXLskills instructor. As a certified instructor, you choose your own hours, topics, and even your own rate! You can use the mobile instructor chat app (powered by Intercom) to answer questions on-the-go, or use the web application to go deep with learners via chat, screen share, and video!
